# functional-diversity
The R scripts used for data analysis and vidualization of the paper "Gharamani, P., Hajializadeh, P., Maghsoodi, P., Azizi, S., Ghodrati Shojaei, M., Naderloo, R. (2025). Macrobenthos of Natural vs. Planted Mangroves: Species Compositions and Functional Perspective. Marine Environmental Research. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2025.107525 . It is on functional diversity of mangrove benthic fauna.

The included scripted are:

1. for computing species diversity indices, Functional diversity indices, and Ecological quality status indices.
2. calculation of dissimilarity between stations with Gower dissimilarity procedure.
3. analysis of data using Shapiro Wilk, ANOVA, PERMANOVA, Tukey's, and pairwise PERMANOVA.
4. visualization of data with bar plots, box plots, and multivariate visualization methods like nMDS and PCA.
